                        As mentioned earlier, browsers and servers have <strong>caching policies</strong>.
                        When, where, and for how long a web item is cached depends on so called
                        <strong>cache-control headers</strong>. These are <strong>HTTP-headers</strong> which are being added
                        by a request of the client or by a response of a server. These headers are also called
                        <strong>cache directives</strong>.

                        The foregoing shows that the <strong>cache policy</strong> of a browser or server also
                        influences how fast a web item is loaded in a
                        browser. For example, if an item has a no-store cache-control header,
                        it must always be retrieved from the origin server. On the other hand if, for
                        example, the
                        client accepts a “stale” item, then it can simply be fetched from a cache if it
                        exists there.
