				When you visit a website, your host device sends a HTTP request to the webserver.
				HTTP is a protocol used for communication between the client and the server.
				After the HTTP request the webserver will send the content back to the client. It can take a relatively long time
				before the requested file, for example a html file will be received by the client.
				One of the reasons might be a lot of traffic at the server, or simply because the
				request and response have to travel a long distance through a lot of nodes.
				Webbrowsing speed can become very low because of this kind of problems. To alleviate
				this, webcaches can be used. They can reduce the request and response time and hence
				increase your webbrowsing speed.

				Webcaches save files and send them to the client upon requests. They can be present
				in the computer of the client or they can be located somewhere between the client
				and the webserver. In the second case it is also considered a server. On this website
				<a href = "browser-and-proxy-caches.html" target = "_self">several kinds of caches</a> and
				<a href = "forward-and-reverse-caching.html" target="_self">several ways of caching</a>
				will be introduced, <a href = "cache-control.html" target="_self">cache control</a>, 
				<a href = "cache-clusters.html" target="_self">cache clusters and inter-cache protocols</a>
				will also be discussed.
