					<h3 class="section__heading">Grouped caches</h3>
					<p>
					Most of the time cache proxies dont occur as a singular entity but in groups. These groups
					are called <strong>cache clusters</strong>. They are grouped cache proxies which are connected 
					with eachother to collaborate in order to handle a HTTP request. The caches inside the cluster
					query eachother for items the client requested. For example an item could be found at a 
					sibling cache, or the request can be forwarded to a parent cache, 
					or if there are no more parent caches to the origin server.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 class="section__heading">Cache Hierarchies</h3>
					<p>
					These clusters contain <strong>hierarchies</strong>. Consisting of parents and siblings.
					<strong>Sibling caches</strong> are on the same level. They can only tell eachother if they have a certain item or not.
					They cannot forward a request to eachother. <strong>Parent caches</strong>, to the contrary, can takeover a request of a child.
					That means if a child cannot find the item, it will forward the request to its parent. The parent will
					then handle the request from there. If the last parent cannot realize a hit then it will forward the
					request to the origin server.

					<h3 class="section__heading">Intercache Protocols</h3>
					<p>
					As discussed in the <a href="index.html">introduction</a>, client and server use HTTP to communicate with eachother.
					Caches can use alternative protocols to communicate with eachother. Two of these protocols
					will be discussed here.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 class="section__heading">ICP</h3>
					<p>
					One of the subtitutes for HTTP can be ICP. ICP stands for <strong>Internet Cache Protocol</strong>. This
					protocol can be used between sibling caches.
					This protocol relies on unreliable but fast datapackages. These packages are sent between
					siblings to establish wether they hold the item the client requested. In this case unreliable
					means that packages can be lost. This however reduces the time in which a cache-hit will be realized.
					Since usually it means theres congestion at the chosen sibling cache if a package gets lost.
					The cache will chose a different sibling cache to query if it takes too long. This all will result
					in a faster response to the client.

					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 class="section__heading">HTCP</h3>
					<p>
					HTCP stands for <strong>HyperText Caching Protocol</strong> HTCP is mostly the same as ICP and also uses unreliable packages.
					The biggest difference is that HTCP uses HTTP headers. ICP does not, which makes it harder
					to predict <strong>cache-hits</strong> for ICP. This is because for example, HTTP has cache-control headers, and ICP does not. 
					Since HTCP does contain these headers, it is better in predicting which caches should be
					asked for information.
