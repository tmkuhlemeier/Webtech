                    A <strong>cache</strong> can be located on different places. The first place a web cache can be located is within the physical
                    architecture of the client host. If a page is requested by the client and the client receives a response, it is 
                    possible that this page and its contents can be saved in the host. In a computer this could be a data storage device
                    like a HDD/SDD, or even the RAM and DRAM. When a user presses the back button in a browser, the page and 
                    its contents get retrieved from the data storage device. The <strong>browser cache</strong> makes sure that the client does not 
                    always have to send a request to a server, which is great because all sorts of delays can occur during this process. 
                    The host then only needs to retrieve the item from its own memory.

                    Besides <strong>browser caches</strong>, <strong>proxy caches</strong> exist as well. These caches are present in proxyservers. 
                    The proxy cache is located between web visitors and the webserver, where it <strong>caches</strong> webfiles so that these can be used by 
                    multiple visitors. This cache can be present in the network of the institute in which the client is located, at the ISP or it can be located
                    on the edge of the webserver network. This means that the <strong>proxy cache</strong> can be either client-side or CDN-side
                    (Content Delivery Network). In the latter case the cache would be called a <strong>gateway cache</strong>. The "freshness" of web items within 
                    the proxy is decided by the 
						<a href="cache-control.html">caching policy</a> 
					of the origin server and it depends upon periodic communication between the proxy- and webserver. 
                    If a HTML-document is requested by a client for the first time, it gets retrieved from the webserver. The next time this request is made by 
                    another visitor, it gets retrieved from the <strong>proxy cache</strong>.
